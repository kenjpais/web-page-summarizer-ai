This makes configuration of services more complicated than necessary.\r\n\r\nContinue the resolution of the issue by storing the CA bundle, if any, in the root secret on OpenStack. When coupled with the changes introduced in openshift/cloud-credential-operator#780, this allows us to dole out the bundle to anyone who asks for it via a `CredentialsRequest`.\r\n\r\n~While we're here, we also tweak the configuration for the cloud provider to (a) start generating the configuration file in the new format expected by `cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator` and (b) stop generating an old secret that only the old, now-removed in-tree OpenStack cloud provider needed and used.~\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** I have deferred the above changes to a different PR.",
