Miscellaneous information:


    

Result:
1. Review and update Jest, focus-trap-react, react-tagsinput, react-modal, and other dependencies with incorrect peer dependencies to their latest versions or remove them if they are no longer needed.

2. Remove old polyfills from the console that are no longer supported by OCP console.

3. Replace custom Banner, Bootstrap styles, and Checkbox filters with PatternFly equivalents where possible.

4. Update YAML language server and monaco in the console.

5. Migrate react-helmet to react-helmet-async due to compatibility issues with React 18. Remove all usage of react-helmet from the console code, remove the react-helmet dependency from the console, and remove shared modules for react-helmet.

6. Remove react-measure dependency from the console repo and demo plugin since it is not compatible with React 18. A possible solution is to follow PatternFly and use react-resize-detector instead.
