            "body": "Updating azure-kms-encryption-provider-container image to be consistent with ART for 4.19\n__TLDR__:\nProduct builds by ART can be configured for different base and builder images than corresponding CI\nbuilds. This automated PR requests a change to CI configuration to align with ART's configuration;\nplease take steps to merge it quickly or contact ART to coordinate changes.\n\nThe configuration in the following ART component metadata is driving this alignment request:\n[azure-kms-encryption-provider.yml](https://github.com/openshift/ocp-build-data/tree/dd63d1fcbf9ed1fb6018480cd39d521b93eab749/images/azure-kms-encryption-provider.yml).\n\n__Detail__:\n\nThis repository is out of sync with the downstream product builds for this component. The CI\nconfiguration for at least one image differs from ART's expected product configuration. This should\nbe addressed to ensure that the component's CI testing accurate reflects what customers will\nexperience.\n\nMost of these PRs are opened as an ART-driven proposal to migrate base image or builder(s) to a\ndifferent version, usually prior to GA. The intent is to effect changes in both configurations\nsimultaneously without breaking either CI or ART builds, so usually ART builds are configured to\nconsider CI as canonical and attempt to match CI config until the PR merges to align both. ART may\nalso configure changes in GA releases with CI remaining canonical for a brief grace period to enable\nCI to succeed and the alignment PR to merge. In either case, ART configuration will be made\ncanonical at some point (typically at branch-cut before GA or release dev-cut after GA), so it is\nimportant to align CI configuration as soon as possible.\n\nPRs are also triggered when CI configuration changes without ART coordination, for instance to\nchange the number of builder images or to use a different golang version. These changes should be\ncoordinated with ART; whether ART configuration is canonical or not, preferably it would be updated\nfirst to enable the changes to occur simultaneously in both CI and ART at the same time. This also\ngives ART a chance to validate the intended changes first. For instance, ART compiles most\ncomponents with the Golang version being used by the control plane for a given OpenShift release.\nExceptions to this convention (i.e. you believe your component must be compiled with a Golang\nversion independent from the control plane) must be granted by the OpenShift staff engineers and\ncommunicated to the ART team.\n\n__Roles & Responsibilities__:\n- Component owners are responsible for ensuring these alignment PRs merge with passing\n  tests OR that necessary metadata changes are reported to the ART team: `@release-artists`\n  in `#forum-ocp-art` on Slack. If necessary, the changes required by this pull request can be\n  introduced with a separate PR opened by the component team. Once the repository is aligned,\n  this PR will be closed automatically.\n- In particular, it could be that a job like `verify-deps` is complaining. In that case, please open\n  a new PR with the dependency issues addressed (and base images bumped). [ART-9595](https://issues.redhat.com//browse/ART-9595) for reference.\n- Patch-manager or those with sufficient privileges within this repository may add\n  any required labels to ensure the PR merges once tests are passing. In cases where ART config is\n  canonical, downstream builds are *already* being built with these changes, and merging this PR\n  only improves the fidelity of our CI. In cases where ART config is not canonical, this provides\n  a grace period for the component team to align their CI with ART's configuration before it becomes\n  canonical in product builds.\n\nART has been configured to reconcile your CI build root image (see https://docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/architecture/ci-operator/#build-root-image).\nIn order for your upstream .ci-operator.yaml configuration to be honored, you must set the following in your openshift/release ci-operator configuration file:\n```\nbuild_root:\n  from_repository: true\n```\n\n__Change behavior of future PRs__:\n* In case you just want to follow the base images that ART suggests, you can configure additional labels to be\n  set up automatically. This means that such a PR would *merge without human intervention* (and awareness!) in the future.\n  To do so, open a PR to set the `auto_label` attribute in the image configuration. [Example](https://github.com/openshift-eng/ocp-build-data/pull/1778)\n* You can set a commit prefix, like `UPSTREAM: <carry>: `. [An example](https://github.com/openshift-eng/ocp-build-data/blob/6831b59dddc5b63282076d3abe04593ad1945148/images/ose-cluster-api.yml#L11).\n\nIf you have any questions about this pull request, please reach out to `@release-artists` in the `#forum-ocp-art` coreos slack channel.\n",

Kube-apiserver actually doesn't care about this, but making this required also eliminates `groups` being unset and `groups.claim = \"\"` meaning the same thing - which aligns with our API conventions of only having a single way to \"say\" something.\r\n\r\nThe [username claim mapping is required](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/e98d47001c08f4be174404f60cd38dcbc736a705/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/apis/apiserver/validation/validation.go#L311-L318) for structured authentication configuration entries so this change should be OK to make even though it is a breaking API change.\r\n\r\nThe feature has _not_ shipped on standalone OpenShift (still TP), but _has_ shipped as GA on HyperShift.

The signature of a rebuilt operator catalog is invalid as the operator catalog image differs from the original. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue skipping the signature mirroring for operator catalogs rebuilt.\r\n\r\nGithub / Jira issue: [OCPBUGS-55078](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55078)\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Code Improvements (Refactoring, Performance, CI upgrades, etc)\r\n- [ ] Internal repo assets (diagrams / docs on github repo)\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update on openshift docs\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nWith the following Image Set Configuration:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkind: ImageSetConfiguration\r\napiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1\r\nmirror:\r\n  operators:\r\n    - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.18\r\n      packages:\r\n       - name: aws-load-balancer-operator\r\n       - name: 3scale-operator\r\n       - name: node-observability-operator\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `m2d/d2m` or `m2m` with the flag `--remove-signatures=false`\r\n\r\n## Expected Outcome\r\n\r\nSignatures for the operator catalogs should not be mirrored as in the example below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFetching tags for repository: redhat/redhat-operator-index\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"redhat/redhat-operator-index\",\r\n  \"tags\": [\r\n    \"v4.18\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile the signatures for `aws-load-balancer-operator`,  `3scale-operator` and `node-observability-operator` (and their dependent images) should be in the target registry.",
